## [1.0.0-next.18] - 2025-06-18 - 2025-06-18

### Patch Changes (x.x.1)
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX: maxDepth Content Consistency**: Fixed maxDepth logic to ensure identical total content (pages, characters, tokens) regardless of maxDepth value
- **No Content Duplication**: Completely refactored file collection to process each markdown file exactly once, eliminating duplicate content across output files
- **Proper File Grouping**: maxDepth now correctly groups the same total content into different output files based on directory structure, never omitting or duplicating files
- **Enhanced maxDepth Documentation**: Updated help text and README to clarify that maxDepth controls organization, not content filtering
- **Verification Tested**: Confirmed that sum of all output files at any maxDepth matches the single file output at maxDepth=0

## [1.0.0-next.18] - 2025-06-18

### Minor Changes (x.1.x)
- **Componentized Stats Display System**: Created reusable `displayCustomStatsTable()` function with flexible emoji/title support

## [1.0.0-next.16] - 2025-06-17 - 2025-06-15 - 2025-06-15 - 2025-06-15

### üöÄ Major Enhancements

**Metadata-Driven Architecture Overhaul**
- **Revolutionary File Management**: Complete migration from legacy `${org}-${repo}` filename logic to metadata-driven, versioned filename system
- **Semantic Versioning Integration**: All files now use format `user-repo@1.0.0.md` with automatic GitHub API version detection
- **Robust Metadata System**: Centralized `.vnow/metadata.json` as the single source of truth for all repository tracking and file management

**Enhanced VS Code Copilot Integration**  
- **Smart Context Management**: `enable` and `disable` commands now use metadata for perfect file resolution
- **Append-Only Logic**: `enable` command appends to existing Copilot context instead of replacing it
- **File Existence Verification**: Only existing files are added to VS Code settings, preventing broken references
- **Automatic Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate entries in `.vscode/settings.json`

**Streamlined Command Workflows**
- **Unified `add` Command**: Now properly passes all flags (`--all`, `--min`, `--code`) to install and automatically enables files
- **Robust `remove` Command**: Uses metadata for complete cleanup - deletes all versioned files and removes from settings  
- **Intelligent `disable` Command**: Removes all files for a repository from Copilot context using metadata lookup
- **Enhanced `enable` Command**: Uses metadata to find and enable all generated file types for a repository

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

**GitHub API Integration**
- **Real Version Detection**: Fetches actual semantic versions from GitHub releases API instead of using placeholders
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful handling when API is unavailable or no releases exist
- **Rate Limit Awareness**: Efficient API usage with proper error handling

**File System Robustness** 
- **Atomic Operations**: Install process now has proper error handling with cleanup on failure
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy filename cleanup maintained for smooth migration
- **Directory Management**: Improved handling of empty directories and folder cleanup

**Error Handling & User Experience**
- **Comprehensive Validation**: All commands validate file existence before operations
- **Clear Error Messages**: Improved feedback when repositories or files are not found
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Commands continue working even when metadata is partially corrupted

### ‚úÖ Validation & Testing

**Comprehensive Command Testing**
- All core workflows validated: `add`, `enable`, `disable`, `remove`
- VS Code Copilot integration tested with real repositories
- Metadata consistency verified across multiple install/remove cycles
- File versioning confirmed with semantic version detection

**Quality Assurance**
- Zero legacy filename logic in active code paths (only in cleanup/fallback)
- All commands properly handle edge cases and missing files
- Settings.json integrity maintained across all operations
- Metadata.json serves as reliable source of truth for all file operations

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed**: `enable` command now correctly uses metadata instead of legacy filename guessing
- **Fixed**: `add` command properly passes flags to install and enables the correct generated files  
- **Fixed**: `disable` and `remove` commands use metadata for accurate file identification
- **Fixed**: VS Code settings corruption when enabling/disabling repositories multiple times
- **Fixed**: File deletion edge cases where metadata and actual files were out of sync

### üßπ Code Quality

**Codebase Cleanup**
- **Legacy Code Removal**: Eliminated most `${org}-${repo}` filename logic throughout the codebase
- **Consistent Architecture**: All commands now use the same metadata-driven approach
- **Test Suite Cleanup**: Removed outdated test files that relied on legacy filename patterns
- **Documentation Sync**: Updated all help text and documentation to match new functionality

**Performance Optimizations**  
- **Reduced File I/O**: Metadata-driven lookups eliminate unnecessary file system scanning
- **Efficient Settings Updates**: Smart VS Code settings management with minimal file writes
- **Faster Command Execution**: Streamlined command logic with reduced redundant operations

### üìö Documentation

- **Enhanced README**: Comprehensive feature overview with usage examples and advanced scenarios
- **Updated Help System**: All command help text reflects new metadata-driven functionality  
- **Better Examples**: Real-world usage patterns with popular framework repositories
- **Feature Highlights**: Clear documentation of versioned filenames and VS Code integration benefits

## [1.0.0-next.13] - 2025-06-15

### Added
- **Version detection improvements**: Enhanced version commands to work in both Deno and Node.js environments
- **Build system enhancements**: Streamlined build process without postinstall complexity

### Fixed
- Version commands (`vnow --version`, `vnow upgrade --check`) now correctly detect version in npm-installed packages
- Resolved development vs npm version conflicts by improving version detection logic

### Changed
- **Simplified installation**: Removed postinstall and first-run setup for faster, cleaner installation
- **Streamlined build**: Focuses on core functionality without setup automation
- Version detection now checks both `deno.json` (development) and `package.json` (npm) for maximum compatibility
